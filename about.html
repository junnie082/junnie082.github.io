<h2>Hyojeong Jun</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my git blog, everyone! 

I'm Hyojeong Jun, studying computer science & engineering in college since 2021. I speak Korean, which is my mother tongue, and intermediate English. I know how to introduce myself in Spanish, but that's all. 

I will be updating the blog about Algorithm, Web(front-end, back-end), AI, ... and all the stuff that are related to computer science.
Sometimes, I will upload some posts that are 'not' related to CS, but to the things that I love.

What are the things that I love then?
I love coding, reading, quoridor, scuba diving, dancing, making good friends, exhibitions, kids ... I just love to learn new things.

I started uploading 'the way I study CS' on Instagram every single day (except for weekends).
Please check it out, and you will see how I solve the problems using programming languages: [junnie082cs][insta]
