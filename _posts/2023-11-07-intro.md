I'm interested in improving my skills and abilities through various experiences.
I study computer science in college and I actually solve problems using my knowledge and skills. To prove that I'm really interested in solving problems, I can show you that I have been building many projects: I developed an app for the disabled, made some fun cool games using AI, participated in cyber security contest and got the prize there.
On app project, I directed the team as a leader. I designed the app, developed front-end, and little bit of back-end part, and made presentation materials and actually presented in front of the judges. Unfortunately we didn't win the prize in the contest we've applied but we were able to advance to the finals and got the feedbacks from IT experts. Listening from them and knowing our problems were really helpful when building other projects. I couldn't sleep enough for a month during this contest, but from here I realized that I was able to actually build a project on my own. I was confident from then.
On AI game project, I just wanted to make a board game which I was crazy about, on my own. I wanted to play the game with AI, so I decided to put AI in the game. I coded all the logic in a week and showed the people that it's possible to develop the game. So I succeeded in gathering four (UI Developer, Server Developer, AI Developer) more teammates. We studied the languages and the frameworks we needed. We met every Monday and talked about the problems and bugs we went through. We designed and developed the program together. It took more than 6 months to finish our project. Now we can play the game from all over the world(online mode), practice alone(AI mode), and play with your local friends. I sawed how these developers solve their problems for this 6 months, and I bet I'm a better problem solver now(at least I'm better than I was before the project).
On cyber security contest, our team was studying about cryptography in the club. I learned a lot from the master degree teammates. We analyzed the mechanism of the crypto wallet and experimented some ideas. We got the prize, and we're writing a thesis further. I've implemented brute force algorithm and classified the keys and lengths.
After building many team projects, I realized how hard it was to go through the missions as a team and how to communicate with them for the same goal. Sometimes it was really tough because some members were not passionate that some members didn't show up for the meetings that were held every week, some members were complaining about others' ideas, ... but I think all these procedures helped me to learn about 'teamwork' thinking from now.
I was really bad at explaining my ideas in front of the people and persuading them at first, but after trying and failing several times, now I know the rule. Because of these experiences, I could be the leader of some projects.
I've participated in several group studies too: I'm the only one who has finished all the courses in advanced algorithm solving study among the whole members, and I'm operating Web Hacking Study nowadays.
I'm also the Web CORE member in Google Developer Student Clubs in SeoulTech. My role is to keep organizing the curriculum & session, meeting other cores from other parts, informing and presenting in front of the members. Our team is studying about Back-End engineering (Server, Database Development) these days. We're getting prepared and planning to solve another problem, happening around this world. We'll see if we'll win the prize.

I love to talk to people from many other countries because it's fun and I know it can broaden my perspective of the world. I worked for Awesome English academy for 2 years as an English speaking teacher. I realized how I love kids from this experience and it also helped me to work for kids again in the future. Now I volunteer for the kids in elementary school, teaching them how to code. Now I'm a member of Code Club, consists of 6 members and we go to the elementary school every Wednesday.
I take exchange students in my school to many places in Seoul and show them how cool Korea is. We've gone to Hongdae, Dongdaemun, Nowon, Namsan already. I learned so many things from them (of course not only just English)  and I'm sure they also did learn a lot of things from me.

I'm showing and telling all my projects I've done till now, and the reason is that I want to show you my passion and how I'm interested in this project. Of course it's not because I'm a good programmer or engineer, but because I'm passionate about solving problems, making and building ideas. I really want to try and build a project with the others because I'm sure that it will make me a better person. This project will be a very good experience for me.
